USGS Earthquake Data Visualization Project

Project Overview
Developed an interactive web-based visualization system for the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to display real-time earthquake data globally. This tool addresses USGS's need for effective data presentation to educate the public and other government organizations about seismic activity worldwide.
Technical Challenge
The USGS collects vast amounts of seismic data globally, updated at 5-minute intervals. The challenge was to transform this extensive dataset into an intuitive, interactive visualization that could effectively communicate earthquake patterns and risks to both technical and non-technical audiences.
Implementation Details
Data Integration

Integrated with USGS GeoJSON Feed API for real-time earthquake data
Implemented automated data refresh functionality to maintain current information
Processed and normalized raw seismic data for visualization purposes

Visualization Features

Built an interactive map using Leaflet.js to plot global earthquake locations
Developed dynamic markers that encode multiple data dimensions:

Marker size correlates with earthquake magnitude
Color gradient indicates earthquake depth
Interactive popups display detailed seismic information


Implemented a comprehensive legend system providing context for visual encodings

Technical Architecture

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
Mapping: Leaflet.js library
Data Source: USGS GeoJSON API
Data Processing: Custom JavaScript modules for data transformation

User Interface

Interactive map with zoom and pan capabilities
Click-responsive markers revealing detailed earthquake information
Color-coded depth scale for intuitive understanding
Size-graduated markers indicating magnitude impact
Responsive design for cross-platform compatibility

Impact
This visualization tool enables USGS to:

Present complex seismic data in an accessible format
Educate stakeholders about global seismic activity patterns
Support data-driven decision-making for disaster preparedness
Enhance public understanding of earthquake risks and patterns

Future Enhancements

Implementation of temporal analysis features
Addition of historical data comparison capabilities
Integration of predictive modeling visualizations
Development of custom filtering and search functionality
